# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanveen!

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science & Engineering student at UC Irvine, still emotionally recovering from my first merge conflict.

By day, I write code and break things in increasingly elaborate ways. By night, I spend days configuring Neovim so I can code slightly faster.
It only took me three weeks, two existential crises, and a plugin manager rabbit hole—but hey, my editor loads in 38 milliseconds now.
And yes, I am currently integrating AI-first edge-driven pipelines into a serverless full-duplex prompt orchestration layer. Please don’t ask what that means.

## 💡 Previous Projects
- [Minesweeper Deep Q Learning](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Minesweeper-Deep-Q-Learning):Trained an AI to stop stepping on mines. Took 300,000 deaths, but hey—progress!
- [Chess AI](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Chess-AI): Made a bot that beats me at chess. I created it, so do I suck if I lose?
- [Car Classyfier](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Car-Classyfier): ML model that IDs everything from Civics to Paganis, for when “nice car” isn’t specific enough.
- [Unbeatable Pong](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Unbeatable-Pong): Built a Pong bot with perfect reflexes and zero chill.
- [ML Minesweeper](https://github.com/TanveenBal/ML-Minesweeper): Trained on examples instead of explosions. More academic, less exploding.
- [Music Box](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Music-Box): A Spotify-ish music player—no screen, no app, and mostly just... notes. Like, literal music notes.

## 🛠️  Since knowing every language ever invented is the bare minimum for entry-level SWE jobs, I went ahead and learned all of these:

## ⚙️ I’ve mastered the sacred ritual of gluing random tools together until something deploys:
