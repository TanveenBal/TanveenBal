# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanveen!

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science & Engineering student at UC Irvine, still emotionally recovering from my first merge conflict.

By day, I write code and break things in increasingly elaborate ways. By night, I spend days configuring Neovim so I can code slightly faster.
It only took me three weeks, two existential crises, and a plugin manager rabbit hole—but hey, my editor loads in 38 milliseconds now.
And yes, I am currently integrating AI-first edge-driven pipelines into a serverless full-duplex prompt orchestration layer. Please don’t ask what that means.

## 💡 Previous Projects
- [Minesweeper Deep Q Learning](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Minesweeper-Deep-Q-Learning): Taught an AI to play Minesweeper by bribing it with rewards every time it didn't explode. Still took about 300,000 deaths before it got the gist—progress!
- [Chess AI](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Chess-AI): I built a chess bot using minimax and alpha-beta pruning that consistently beats me. Still not sure if that means it's smart or I just suck at chess. Probably both.
- [Car Classyfier](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Car-Classyfier): Built a model to identify car make, model, and style—because I personally can’t tell if that’s a Lamborghini or a really shiny 2008 Civic. Let the AI judge.
- [Unbeatable Pong](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Unbeatable-Pong): Engineered a Pong AI that never misses, turns out, it’s way less fun when the opponent has perfect reaction time and zero empathy.
- [ML Minesweeper](https://github.com/TanveenBal/ML-Minesweeper): Like my other Minesweeper AI, but instead of learning by repeatedly exploding, this one studied thousands of examples—basically went to school so it could also avoid instant death.
- [Music Box](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Music-Box): Built a hardware music player with play, pause, and resume—basically Spotify, if it had no screen, ran on jumper wires, and absolutely was not Spotify.

## 🛠️  Since knowing every language ever invented is the bare minimum for entry-level SWE jobs, I went ahead and learned all of these:

## ⚙️ I’ve mastered the sacred ritual of gluing random tools together until something deploys:
