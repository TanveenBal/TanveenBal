# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanveen!

I recently graduated with a Computer Science & Engineering at UC Irvine. Currently stuck rebasing a branch that branched off the wrong branch that was branched from main by mistake.

By day, I write code and break things in increasingly elaborate ways. By night, I spend days configuring Neovim so I can code slightly faster.
It only took me three weeks, two existential crises, and a plugin manager rabbit hole but hey, my editor loads in 38 milliseconds now.
And yes, I am currently integrating AI-first edge-driven pipelines into a serverless full-duplex prompt orchestration layer. Please don’t ask what that means.

## 💡 Previous Projects
- [Minesweeper Deep Q Learning](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Minesweeper-Deep-Q-Learning): Trained an AI to stop stepping on mines. Took 300,000+ tries, but hey... progress!
- [Chess AI](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Chess-AI): Made a bot that beats me at chess. I created it, so do I suck if I lose?
- [Car Classyfier](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Car-Classyfier): ML model that IDs everything from Civics to Paganis, for when “nice car” isn’t specific enough.
- [Unbeatable Pong](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Unbeatable-Pong): Built a Pong bot with perfect reflexes and zero chill.
- [ML Minesweeper](https://github.com/TanveenBal/ML-Minesweeper): Trained on examples instead of explosions. More academic, less exploding.
- [Music Box](https://github.com/TanveenBal/Music-Box): A Spotify-ish music player—no screen, no app, and mostly just... notes. Like, literal music notes.

## 🛠️ Programming Language
### Since knowing every language ever is the entry-level standard, I went ahead and learned these:

## ⚙️ Tools
### I’ve mastered the ancient art of gluing tools until something deploys:
